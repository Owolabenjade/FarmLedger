Building a farm management tool that utilizes smart contracts to manage agricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, etc.), labor, and equipment. The tool could help in planning and recording farming activities, inventory management, and financial accounting, all stored securely on the blockchain to aid in decision-making and audit trails.
