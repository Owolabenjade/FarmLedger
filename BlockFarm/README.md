# EcoFarm Smart Contract

The EcoFarm Smart Contract is designed for agricultural cooperatives and other organizations to manage their resources, labor, and equipment efficiently. It acts as a comprehensive digital ledger system on the blockchain, ensuring secure transactions, reliable data storage, and access control for managing operational inputs.

## Features

- **Resource Management**: Track and manage resources like seeds, fertilizers, and other agricultural inputs with details such as quantity and unit price.
- **Labor Management**: Record details about workers or contractors, including their names and hourly rates.
- **Equipment Management**: Log equipment with attributes like name and maintenance schedules, facilitating effective maintenance planning.
- **Initialization Control**: Ensure the contract is initialized only once to prevent data tampering and maintain system integrity.
- **Access Control**: Limit critical actions (like adding or modifying data) to the contract owner, preventing unauthorized access.
- **Validation Mechanisms**: Robust input validation for IDs, strings, and unsigned integers to maintain data quality.
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error codes help manage issues such as unauthorized access, existing IDs, and invalid inputs efficiently.
- **Data Updates and Deletion**: Functions to update and delete entries ensure the data remains current and accurate.

## Prerequisites

- Stacks Blockchain API
- Clarity Smart Contract language knowledge
- A wallet with STX for deploying the contract

## Installation

Before deploying the contract, ensure you have the required environment set up:

1. **Install Clarinet**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @hirosystems/clarinet
   ```

2. **Setup your Clarity project**:
   ```bash
   clarinet new ecofarm-contract
   cd ecofarm-contract
   ```

3. **Add the EcoFarm contract**:
   - Place the `.clar` file containing the smart contract code in the `contracts` directory of your Clarinet project.

## Deployment

To deploy the EcoFarm Smart Contract on the testnet or mainnet, follow these steps:

1. **Edit your `Clarinet.toml`** to specify the network settings.
2. **Deploy the contract** using Clarinet:
   ```bash
   clarinet deploy --network [testnet|mainnet]
   ```

## Usage

After deployment, the contract can be interacted with through transactions for various operations:

- **Initialize the contract**:
  ```bash
  clarinet console --network [testnet|mainnet]
  (contract-call? .ecofarm initialize-contract)
  ```

- **Add a resource**:
  ```clarity
  (contract-call? .ecofarm add-resource u1 "High-Quality Seeds" u100 u50)
  ```

- **Add labor**:
  ```clarity
  (contract-call? .ecofarm add-labor u1 "John Doe" u20)
  ```

- **Add equipment**:
  ```clarity
  (contract-call? .ecofarm add-equipment u1 "Tractor" "Monthly")
  ```

## Contract Functions

The contract includes several public functions that can be used as follows:

- `initialize-contract`: Initializes the contract for use, can only be called once.
- `add-resource`: Adds a new resource entry to the system.
- `add-labor`: Records a new labor entry.
- `add-equipment`: Logs new equipment along with its maintenance schedule.
- `update-equipment`: Updates the details of existing equipment.
- `delete-equipment`: Removes an equipment entry from the system.
- `view-equipment`: Retrieves the details of a specific piece of equipment.
